whats the point of an intro? hook the readers to make them read the essay. motivating them to read
who is our audeince? freshmen english students
contextualize the subject? who is eric garner in one or two words.
define literary terms that come up in our essay
we didnt write introduction yet because we need to define our thesis
analysis paragraphs need to start with a claim. Specific to the evidence in the paragraph. claim, evidence, analysis, and synthesis in every paragraph
what does conclusion do? synthesize argument. why should anybody care? motivating them to continue learning after reading
dont use "I think" in essay, it points towards opinion instead of the evidence.
remove "the speaker" uses and use the literary terms! (the imagery of something does something else)

2. Copy and paste claims from zero draft. Revise the claims.
